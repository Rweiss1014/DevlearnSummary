# HIPAA Compliance Review - AssistRx Training Module

## Learning Objectives

1. **Identify PHI and Access**: Identify what constitutes Protected Health Information (PHI) and recognize appropriate versus inappropriate access.

2. **Apply Best Practices**: Apply HIPAA-compliant best practices to prevent unintentional breaches during daily tasks and interactions.

3. **Respond to Violations**: Respond confidently and appropriately when HIPAA concerns arise, including how and when to escalate or report violations.

## What is Protected Health Information (PHI)?

Protected Health Information includes anything that can identify an individual:
- Name
- Date of birth
- Medical record number
- Diagnosis
- Insurance details
- Even information that doesn't seem 'sensitive'

### Forms of PHI:

**Verbal**: Saying an individual's full name and treatment information

**Written**: Handwritten notes or documents

**Electronic**: Emails, shared files, system screens

## PHI in Your Day-to-Day Work

- **Phone Calls**: Repeating names, confirming treatment, handling complaints
- **Systems**: Case notes, enrollment records, referral documents
- **Emails**: PHI in subject lines, forwarded messages, or sent without encryption
- **Documents**: Scanned forms, intake paperwork, faxes, and internal spreadsheets
- **Screens**: Leaving systems open or visible in shared spaces

## Protecting PHI: Legal and Ethical Obligations

### Legal Protection
HIPAA sets national standards for safeguarding individual information; violations can result in financial penalties, lawsuits, or loss of access.

### Trust
Individuals need to feel secure sharing information - if that trust is broken, care may be avoided or delayed.

### Ethical Obligation
As healthcare professionals, protecting privacy is a core part of our responsibility.

### Organization Impact
A HIPAA breach affects not just the individual but the reputation and operational standing of the entire program.

## Role-Based Access to PHI

- Permissions are assigned based on the specific responsibilities of a role
- Platforms like CaseAssist, Patient Access systems, or intake software restrict access by tier or workflow level
- If you believe you've accessed something in error or have concerns about system permissions, report it immediately

**IMPORTANT: Curiosity ≠ Compliance**
Just because you can view something doesn't mean you should! Know who to contact if your access seems misaligned.

## Accessing PHI: Only on a Need-To-Know Basis

You should only access information directly related to your current job function or assigned cases.

### Examples of Inappropriate Access:
- Looking up a friend or relative's information
- Reviewing a case out of curiosity, not responsibility
- Pulling data "just to see what happened" after an interaction ends

## Securing PHI

### Logging In/Out
Always use your own login and log out when done or switching devices.

### Device Security
Use secure, approved tools for work, avoid personal devices, and report any lost or compromised equipment immediately.

### Screen Privacy
Lock your screen when away and protect on-screen info in shared or public spaces.

## Common Ways HIPAA Violations Occur

These are the most common ways HIPAA violations occur - not through bad intentions, but through simple oversights:

### Unlocked Screens
Walking away from an open workstation - even for a moment - can expose PHI. Always lock your screen (Ctrl + Alt + Del or Command + Control + Q) before stepping away.

### Sending PHI to the Wrong Recipient
Common via email, fax, or internal messaging. Double-check the recipient field, attachments, and CCs before sending. If you catch a mistake, report it right away - don't try to correct it on your own or delay reporting.

### Failing to Authenticate Callers
Sharing PHI without properly verifying who's on the line is a serious risk. Always follow your team's authentication process before disclosing any individual information.

## Accidental Exposure of PHI

### Example 1: Misdirected Email
Accidentally sending PHI to the wrong email = breach, even if quickly corrected

### Example 2: Forgotten Logout
Forgetting to log out or authenticate a caller = breach, even if no harm was intended

**IMPORTANT**: Individuals have the right to know when their information is mishandled - even when no disciplinary action is taken, every incident is investigated and reviewed.

HIPAA protects both people and trust - owning our role is part of being a professional!

## Reporting Noncompliance

### What to do if you make or witness a mistake:

- Don't try to fix it alone or delete records - transparency is key
- If PHI was sent to the wrong person, write down:
  - What was shared
  - How it happened
  - Who may have seen it
  - When it occurred
- If you witness a coworker's mistake, approach them directly if appropriate, or escalate to a manager

### Who to notify and how to report:

- Notify your lead or manager immediately
- Managers will complete the **Nonconformance Form** for any potential HIPAA breach

## Best Practices for Protecting PHI

### 1. Pause and Protect Mindset
Slow down before accessing or sharing information.

### 2. Use Secure Systems and Communication
Never send PHI through unsecured channels (e.g., personal email, non-secure chat).

### 3. Mindfulness in Shared Spaces
Be aware of surroundings during virtual meetings and open offices.

### 4. Clean Desk and Lock Screen Culture
Keep your desk clean and lock your screen every time you step away.

## HIPAA Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Misdirected Email
A team member sends a case update to the wrong internal contact. The recipient isn't assigned to that individual.
**Result**: This is a HIPAA breach that must be reported.

### Scenario 2: Unlocked Screen
An individual's name and details are visible on a screen left open in a shared workspace during lunch.
**Result**: This is a HIPAA breach that must be reported.

### Scenario 3: Caller Verification Skipped
A rep speaks with someone who claims to be the individual's caregiver but doesn't verify identity before discussing PHI.
**Result**: This is a HIPAA breach that must be reported.

### Scenario 4: Curiosity Access
A team member looks up a former individual's record just to "see how things ended up."
**Result**: This is inappropriate access and a HIPAA breach that must be reported.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PHI is everywhere**: From phone calls to emails to open screens - PHI can show up in expected and unexpected places. Be alert and intentional.

2. **Report immediately**: If you make or witness a mistake, report it immediately using the Nonconformance Form. Timely reporting allows for corrective action and protects everyone involved.

3. **Prevention is key**: Following best practices like locking your screen, verifying callers, and using secure systems prevents most violations.

4. **Trust matters**: Protecting PHI is not just about compliance - it's about maintaining the trust individuals place in us when they share their health information.
