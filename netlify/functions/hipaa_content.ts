** SLIDE CONTENT **
HIPAA Compliance Review What is Protected Health Information? Verbal This includes saying an individual’s full name and treatment Electronic This includes emails, shared files, system screens Written This includes handwritten notes or documents Protected Health Information includes anything that can identify an individual - name, date of birth, medical record number, diagnosis, insurance details - even if it doesn’t seem ‘sensitive’.



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Use this slide to clearly define Protected Health Information (PHI) in a way that connects with participants' real-world tasks Emphasize that PHI isn't just medical records - it includes verbal conversations, emails, and even sticky notes Ensure participants understand that HIPAA applies across all formats: verbal , written, and electronic Reinforce that identifying PHI correctly is the first step to preventing a violation Engagement Prompt: “Can anyone name a few examples of PHI you might come across in your individual role?” (Pause to allow a few examples, and affirm or clarify as needed) Suggested Script “One of the most important things we can do to stay compliant is to recognize PHI when we see it. Protected Health Information includes anything that can identify an individual - name, date of birth, medical record number, diagnosis, insurance details - even if it doesn’t seem ‘sensitive.’ It’s also important to remember that PHI exists in a variety of formats - not just in medical charts or written forms. It can show up in emails, over the phone, in faxes, or on screens left open.” Detailed Talking Points PHI includes 18 identifiers such as name, address, email, phone number, SSN, insurance ID, and medical conditions PHI can be: Verbal (e.g., saying a n individual’s full name and treatment over the phone) Written (e.g., handwritten notes or documents) Electronic (e.g., emails, shared files, system screens) Unintentional exposure of PHI (even without malicious intent) can be a HIPAA violation Minimum necessary access is always the rule - more on that in upcoming slides Final Takeaways You interact with PHI more often than you may realize Recognizing it is the first line of defense in compliance Don’t assume something isn’t PHI just because it doesn’t look “medical” Transition Statement: “Now that we know what PHI is, let’s look at where it typically shows up in your workflow - and where you need to be most alert.” 4

HIPAA Compliance Review PHI In Your Day-to-Day Work Phone Calls Systems Emails Documents Screens Repeating names, confirming treatment, handling complaints Case notes, enrollment records, referral documents PHI in subject lines, forwarded messages, or sent without encryption Scanned forms, intake paperwork, faxes, and internal spreadsheets Leaving systems open or visible in shared spaces



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Help participants connect the concept of PHI to their specific tasks and systems Give examples from real workflows (without naming individuals) to reinforce how easily PHI shows up throughout the day Emphasize constant awareness - HIPAA compliance isn’t just about what’s in the system; it’s also about how we communicate and store information Suggested Script “Now that we’ve talked about what PHI is, let’s explore where it lives in your day-to-day work. Because HIPAA compliance isn’t just about what you access - it’s about how you handle what you access. You’ll come across PHI in calls with individuals or providers, through system screens, emails, intake forms, or even quick notes jotted down. Anywhere you see or hear identifiers, that’s PHI - and that’s when your HIPAA awareness needs to kick in.” Detailed Talking Points Phone Calls : Repeating individual names, confirming treatments, handling complaints Systems : Case notes, enrollment records, referral documents Emails : PHI included in subject lines, shared in forwarded messages, or sent without encryption Documents : Scanned forms, intake paperwork, faxes, and internal spreadsheets Screens : Leaving systems open or visible in shared spaces Even chat tools or note apps can unintentionally store PHI if used without care Final Takeaways PHI can show up in places you don’t expect - your role requires vigilance The format doesn’t matter - what matters is whether it can be tied to an individual Always ask: “Do I need this information?” and “Am I handling it correctly?” Transition Statement: “Now that you’re thinking about where PHI appears, let’s talk about why protecting it matters - not just from a legal perspective, but from a trust and ethics standpoint too.” 5

HIPAA Compliance Review Protecting PHI: Legal and Ethical Obligations Legal Protection HIPAA sets national standards for safeguarding individual information; violations can result in financial penalties, lawsuits, or loss of access Trust Ethical Obligation Organization Impact Individuals need to feel secure sharing information - if that trust is broken, care may be avoided or delayed As healthcare professionals, protecting privacy is a core part of our responsibility A HIPAA breach affects not just the individual but the reputation and operational standing of the entire program



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Use this slide to move beyond the technicalities and help participants connect emotionally and ethically with the importance of HIPAA Reinforce that HIPAA isn’t just a legal requirement - it’s about maintaining trust with individuals and upholding professional integrity Emphasize that every interaction with PHI represents a legal, ethical, and reputational risk or safeguard depending on how it’s handled Engagement Prompt: “Why do you think individuals have to trust us with their information - and what happens if we break that trust?” (Allow for discussion around confidentiality, individual comfort, and legal accountability.) Suggested Script “HIPAA isn’t just a set of rules. It’s a commitment - to individuals, to our organization, and to ourselves as professionals. Yes, there are legal requirements, and violations can result in fines or job consequences. But beyond that, HIPAA builds the trust that allows individuals to feel safe and supported. When we protect PHI, we’re telling individuals: ‘We respect you. We’re here for you. And your private information is safe with us.’ That’s a big deal - especially when working with sensitive populations or high-stakes care.” Detailed Talking Points Legal Protection : HIPAA sets national standards for safeguarding individual information; violations can result in financial penalties, lawsuits, or loss of access Trust : individuals need to feel secure sharing information - if that trust is broken, care may be avoided or delayed Ethical Obligation : As healthcare professionals, protecting privacy is a core part of our responsibility Organizational Impact : A HIPAA breach affects not just the individual but the reputation and operational standing of the entire program Final Takeaways HIPAA is not just about avoiding penalties - it’s about building a safe, respectful experience for every individual Protecting PHI is part of what makes you a trustworthy and ethical representative HIPAA compliance = good healthcare + good business + good ethics Transition Statement: “Let’s now look at one of the most critical components of HIPAA compliance - how access to individual information is structured and why it must be role-based.” 6

** SLIDE CONTENT **
HIPAA Compliance Review Role Based Access to PHI Curiosity ≠ Compliance: Just because you can view something doesn’t mean you should! Know who to contact if your access seems misaligned. Permissions are assigned based on the specific responsibilities of a role Platforms like CaseAssist, Patient Access systems, or intake software restrict access by tier or workflow level If you believe you’ve accessed something in error or have concerns about system permissions, report it immediately



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Use this slide to ground participants in the concept of " need-to-know" access Reinforce that even within a secure system, not all users should access all information - access is tied directly to job function Clarify how permissions are set in their systems (e.g., CaseAssist), and who to reach out to if access concerns arise Suggested Script “In healthcare, access to information is powerful - but with that power comes responsibility. Role-based access ensures that we only see what we need to see in order to perform our job duties. Our systems are designed with this in mind. Whether you're in a CSR role, a supervisor, or a pharmacist within AssistRx - the access you have is intentionally structured to limit exposure to sensitive data that’s not relevant to your function.” Detailed Talking Points Role-Based Access : Permissions are assigned based on the specific responsibilities of a role System Controls : Platforms like CaseAssist, Patient Access systems, or intake software restrict access by tier or workflow level Access Reviews : These are periodically audited to ensure no one has inappropriate or outdated access Your Responsibility : If you believe you’ve accessed something in error or have concerns about system permissions, report it immediately Curiosity ≠ Compliance : Just because you can view something doesn’t mean you should Final Takeaways Only access information that you need to do your job Role-based access is there to protect the individual - and to protect you Know who to contact if your access seems misaligned or you’re unsure what’s appropriate Transition Statement: “Now that we’ve covered how your access is structured, let’s talk about when it’s okay to use that access - and when it crosses the line.” 7

HIPAA Compliance Review Looking up a friend or relative’s information Reviewing a case out of curiosity, not responsibility Pulling data “just to see what happened” after an interaction ends Accessing PHI: Only on a Need-To-Know Basis You should only access information directly related to your current job                                function or assigned cases. Below are examples of Inappropriate Access:



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Reinforce that “need-to-know” is the guiding principle for all access to individual information Clarify that even well-intentioned or curious access is a HIPAA violation Help participants understand the human impact of inappropriate access, not just the policy consequences Make space for respectful discussion - this can be a moment of awareness for many Suggested Script “Let’s talk about when it’s appropriate to access an individual’s information - and when it’s not. In general, if you don’t need the information to do your job, you should not access it. That’s the ‘need-to-know’ rule in practice. If you’re not actively supporting the individual, processing their information, or required to review their case - it’s off-limits. We’ve all seen situations where someone looks up a case they’re curious about, or a family member, or even a public figure. Even if it’s just a peek - that’s a violation. And the consequences are serious - for the organization and for the individual.” Detailed Talking Points Need-to-Know Rule : You should only access information directly related to your current job function or assigned individual cases Inappropriate Access Examples : Looking up a friend or relative’s information Reviewing a case out of curiosity, not responsibility Pulling data “just to see what happened” after an interaction ends Curiosity = Violation : Can result in disciplinary action, job loss, and reportable HIPAA breaches Breaches individual trust and creates reputational harm Final Takeaways Access should be intentional and justifiable - not casual Curiosity is understandable, but acting on it is a compliance risk Respecting boundaries protects you, your coworkers, and every individual we serve Transition Statement: “Now that we’ve clarified when access is appropriate, let’s look at some everyday practices that keep PHI secure - starting with login habits, device use, and screen privacy.” 8

HIPAA Compliance Review Protecting information isn’t just about access - it’s also about securing our devices and workspaces. Whether you’re working remotely or onsite, your login and screen habits play a huge role in keeping PHI safe. Logging In/Out: Always use your own login and log out when done or switching devices. Device Security: Use secure, approved tools for work, avoid personal devices, and report any lost or compromised equipment immediately. Screen Privacy: Lock your screen when away and protect on-screen info in shared or public spaces. Securing PHI



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Emphasize that HIPAA protection isn't only about what you access - it’s also about how you secure it Highlight that simple, routine actions (like walking away from an unlocked screen) are some of the most common causes of unintentional breaches Reinforce that proactive privacy habits protect both individuals and staff from data exposure and reputational risk Suggested Script “Protecting individual information isn’t just about access - it’s also about securing our devices and workspaces. Whether you’re working remotely or onsite, your login and screen habits play a huge role in keeping PHI safe. That includes logging out of systems when not in use, locking your screen when you step away, and being mindful of who can see or overhear PHI on your screen or during a call. These small moments - forgotten screens, shared monitors, unsecured devices - are where a lot of accidental HIPAA issues happen.” Detailed Talking Points Logging In/Out : Use only your own credentials - never share logins Always log out at the end of the day or when switching devices Device Security : Avoid using unsecured personal devices for work tasks Use VPNs and approved tools for remote access Report any lost or compromised devices immediately Screen Privacy : Lock your screen ( Ctrl+Alt+Del / Command+Control+Q ) when stepping away Be aware of screen visibility during meetings, in shared spaces, or while working remotely Use privacy screens or position monitors away from public view Final Takeaways Even unintentional exposure of PHI can result in a HIPAA violation Building secure habits is a form of daily compliance Treat every screen, device, and login as if an individual were standing beside you Transition Statement: “Now that we’ve covered some of these everyday safeguards, let’s look at where HIPAA violations most often happen - and how to avoid the most common pitfalls.” 9

** SLIDE CONTENT **
HIPAA Compliance Review Common Ways HIPAA Violations Occur These are the most common ways HIPAA violations occur - not through bad intentions, but through simple oversights that can happen in fast-paced work environments. Unlocked Screens: Walking away from an open workstation - even for a moment - can expose PHI.  Always lock your screen (Ctrl + Alt + Del or Command + Control + Q) before stepping away. Sending PHI to the Wrong Recipient : Common via email, fax, or internal messaging. Double-check the recipient field, attachments, and CCs before sending.  If you catch a mistake, report it right away - don’t try to correct it on your own or delay reporting. Failing to Authenticate Callers : Sharing PHI without properly verifying who’s on the line is a serious risk.  Always follow your team’s authentication process before disclosing any individual information.



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Normalize that these are common, not careless mistakes - which makes awareness and habit-building even more critical Encourage participants to reflect on their own habits and stay curious about where small gaps may exist Emphasize that HIPAA violations often come from routine moments - not major system errors Engagement Prompt: “Which of these do you think happens most easily - even when people are trying to do the right thing?” (Encourage discussion, then validate the importance of slowing down and double-checking.) Suggested Script “These are the most common ways HIPAA violations occur - not through bad intentions, but through simple oversights that can happen in fast-paced work environments. Whether it’s leaving a screen unlocked, skipping caller verification, or accidentally sending an email to the wrong person, each of these moments carries risk - and often, they’re preventable with a little extra awareness.” Detailed Talking Points Unlocked Screens : Walking away from an open workstation - even for a moment - can expose PHI Always lock your screen (Ctrl + Alt + Del or Command + Control + Q) before stepping away Failing to Authenticate Callers/ Oversharing on the Phone : Sharing PHI without properly verifying who’s on the line is a serious risk Always follow your team’s authentication process before disclosing any individual information Use discretion when speaking - even if the caller is verified, be mindful of who might overhear Sending PHI to the Wrong Recipient : Common via email, fax, or internal messaging Double-check the recipient field, attachments, and CCs before sending If you catch a mistake, report it right away - don’t try to correct it on your own or delay reporting Final Takeaways These errors are easy to make - but they’re also easy to prevent with good habits HIPAA is about consistent, mindful action in every interaction Everyone plays a role in preventing breaches - regardless of role or experience Transition Statement: “Now let’s take a closer look at why these mistakes still matter - even if you didn’t mean for them to happen. In HIPAA, intent doesn’t erase impact.” 10

** SLIDE CONTENT **
HIPAA Compliance Review Accidentally sending PHI to the wrong email = breach, even if quickly corrected Example 1 Forgetting to log out or authenticate a caller = breach, even if no harm was intended Example 2 Accidental Exposure of PHI Individuals have the right to know when their information is mishandled - even when no disciplinary action is taken, every incident is investigated and reviewed. HIPAA protects both people and trust - owning our role is part of being a professional!



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Use this slide to reinforce that good intentions do not exempt actions from consequences when it comes to HIPAA Shift the group’s mindset from “I didn’t mean to” toward “I’m responsible for what I do and what I overlook” Highlight that even if a breach happens by accident, it can still cause harm to individuals, damage trust, and lead to regulatory consequences Engagement Prompt: “Why do you think it’s important to hold ourselves accountable even when a mistake wasn’t intentional?” (Encourage reflection on the individual experience and long-term consequences.) Suggested Script “One of the biggest misconceptions about HIPAA is that if you didn’t mean to do something, it’s not a big deal. But the truth is - intent doesn’t erase impact. You could be trying to help, moving fast, or distracted - but if PHI is exposed, it’s still a breach. And individuals don’t always get to see our intent - they only feel the outcome. This doesn’t mean we need to work in fear. It just means we need to work with awareness and accountability.” Detailed Talking Points Accidental exposure still triggers required reporting, documentation, and sometimes regulatory involvement Examples: Accidentally sending PHI to the wrong email = breach, even if quickly corrected Forgetting to log out or authenticate a caller = breach, even if no harm was intended Individuals have the right to know when their information is mishandled - Even when no disciplinary action is taken, every incident is investigated and reviewed HIPAA protects both people and trust - owning our role is part of being a professional Final Takeaways Intent may explain how something happened, but it doesn’t undo the impact The standard is not perfection - it’s awareness and responsibility Staying vigilant helps protect individuals, your role, and the organization Transition Statement: “Now that we understand why unintentional actions still matter, let’s talk through how to report a potential breach.” 11

HIPAA Compliance Review What to do if you make or witness a mistake: Don’t try to fix it alone or delete records - transparency is key. If PHI was sent to the wrong person, write down: What was shared How it happened Who may have seen it When it occurred If you witness a coworker’s mistake, approach them directly if appropriate, or escalate to a manager. Protecting PHI: Reporting Noncompliance



** FACILITATOR NOTES **
Facilitator Notes/Insights to Speak to: Reassure participants that mistakes can happen - what’s critical is how they’re addressed. Emphasize the culture of accountability and compliance: reporting is a responsible, expected action - not tattling or punitive. Show the Nonconformance Form screenshot and walk through how and when to use it. Normalize escalation as a form of individual and brand protection. Suggested Script “Mistakes can happen - especially when we’re working fast or juggling a lot. The most important thing is what you do next.” “If you accidentally expose PHI, or if you notice something concerning, report it right away. Not just because it’s required - but because it gives our compliance team a chance to minimize any impact to the individual and ensure it doesn’t happen again.” Detailed Talking Points What to do if you make or witness a mistake: Don’t try to fix it alone or delete records - transparency is key. If PHI was sent to the wrong person, write down: What was shared How it happened Who may have seen it When it occurred If you witness a coworker’s mistake, approach them directly if appropriate or escalate to a manager. 12

Detailed Talking Points Who to notify and how to report: Notify your lead or manager immediately. Managers will complete the Nonconformance Form for any potential HIPAA breach. Walk through the Nonconformance Form: Category : Select Potential HIPAA Breach Description : Include detailed call or event summary Corrective Actions : If known, note how the situation was contained Root Cause : Optional at time of report - if known, include it Preventive Actions : What could prevent this in the future? ARx ID : Enter the AssistRx ID Reported By : Select your name from the list Additional Notifications I–V: Select up to five additional team members or leaders who were notified of the event. Only complete these if notifications were made - leave blank otherwise. Date Event Discovered: Enter the date you first became aware of the issue - not necessarily the day it occurred. Date Event Occurred: Enter the date the event actually happened (or when you became aware it occurred). Your Name : Type your full name for verification and documentation purposes. Client : Select the client associated with the impacted case or workflow. Covered Entity (Pharmacy-specific): If this report involves pharmacy-related PHI, select the relevant covered entity. Supporting Documentation (Optional): Upload any screenshots, email chains, or related files that help explain or verify the situation. Important reminder: Reporting is not disciplinary. It’s part of maintaining ethical and regulatory compliance. Final Takeaways Don’t wait - report concerns as soon as they arise. Even if you're unsure, it’s better to report than to assume it's nothing. Protecting individual privacy is everyone’s job - and the system is built to support that. Transition Statement: “Now that we understand why unintentional actions still matter, let’s talk about the best practices that can help you prevent these kinds of breaches in the first place.” 13
